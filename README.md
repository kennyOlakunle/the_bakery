# Task 2: The Bookshop

### Kehinde Abe

You are given a dataset bbc_news.csv which contains over two thousand text stories of the BBC website in a range of subjects including sport, entertainment, and politics. 

Approached by a client, a chain of bookshops all around the UK, you are asked to create an analysis of the dataset and propose a solution to automatically find relevant stories that are important to them in their business.

Explain how your solution could help the client with their business, e.g. how could it improve sales, adhere to customer needs or guide their inventory selection.

Please deliver a report with maximum of 500 words and at most 3 figures summarising your analysis and solution, and provide them with appropriate insight to the problem. Report also any issues or limitations in the data and provide the code you used to perform the analysis and modelling. Ideally, if you also include a plan how you would use large language models to improve your solution provided you are given access to appropriate resources.

Note that we do not expect you to spend more than four hours on this task.
